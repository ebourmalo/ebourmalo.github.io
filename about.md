I'm Emmanuel Bourmalo, 26 years old, living in Nantes in France. 
I'm a javascript and real-time enthusiast, also interested in Ruby on Rails.
I was working for [iAdvize](http://www.iadvize.com/) (Nantes, France) until end 2014 as a javascript expert (mainly Node.js).
I recently had a break and spent a few months in New Zealand for achieving the [Te Araroa Trail](http://www.teararoa.org.nz/) (a 3000+ kms walk).

I'm a [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) philosopher and really enjoy working in startups.

I'm currently looking for a position in Nantes or possibly working remotly.
