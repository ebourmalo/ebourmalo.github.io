![](/assets/images/avatar.png "profile")I'm Emmanuel Bourmalo, 26 years old, living in Nantes (France). 
I'm a javascript & real-time enthusiast, addict to the [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle and also interested in the Ruby on Rails community.
I was working for [iAdvize](http://www.iadvize.com/), leader in customer engagment, as a javascript expert (mainly Node.js) until end 2014.

I recently had a break and spent a few months in New Zealand for achieving the [Te Araroa Trail](http://www.teararoa.org.nz/) (a 3000+ kms walk).

I really enjoy working in startups and I'm currently looking for starting a new adventure.
